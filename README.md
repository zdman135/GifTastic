> app hits giphy api and loads some gifs to see


## How to use

- click on car brand
- click on the images to play the gif

- add your own car brand by typing it in the text box then click add


### Additional Notes

1. This app was pretty straightforward. Had to ensure the gif was available for play after 1 click and another click stop, and another click resume play.

2. Once that issue was solved everything was pretty simple.
